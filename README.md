# Human Anatomy AR Explorer

A final-year AR/VR project for presenting the human anatomy in a 3D interactive environment. Users can tap or select organs to view names, functions, simulations, and audio descriptions — aimed at making anatomy learning immersive and intuitive.

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive 3D human anatomy model with organ-level detail  
- Tap/click any organ to display:  
  - Organ name  
  - Function summary  
  - Animated simulation (where applicable)  
  - Audio description for accessibility  
- Augmented Reality (AR) mode — place the anatomy model in your real-world environment (no headset required)  
- Clean UI built with React and modern web tech (TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS)  
- Backend (if applicable) or asset-pipeline support for managing 3D models and audio assets  
- Deployed demo available [here](https://arproject-one.vercel.app/)

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS  
- **3D & AR**: WebXR / Three.js / AR.js (or your chosen library)  
- **Assets**: High-quality 3D organ models, animations, audio narration  
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Vercel (or your chosen platform)  
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub

## 🛠️ Installation & Running Locally

1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raj-pandith/finalyearARAnatomyproject2.git
   cd finalyearARAnatomyproject2
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open in browser:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown) and enable camera access to test AR mode.

## 🎓 Usage & Learning Goals

* Intended as an educational tool for students of anatomy — helps visualise and interact with organs rather than just reading textbooks.
* Useful for self-study or classroom demonstrations.
* Offers an exploratory mode so users can discover organ systems at their own pace.

## ✅ Future Enhancements

* Add **system-based views** (for example, circulatory, nervous, digestive) so users can isolate and explore each system.
* Add **multi-language audio narration** (e.g., English, Hindi) for wider accessibility.
* Add **quiz / assessment mode**: After exploring, users answer questions about organ functionality, location, etc.
* Add **VR headset support** (e.g., WebXR VR mode) for immersive classroom sessions.
* Optimize loading of 3D models and assets for slower devices (lazy-load, compression, LODs).
